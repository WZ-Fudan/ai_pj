# Introduction

In this project, we implement Mento Carlo Tree Search and alphago zero algorithm to generate a high quality gomoku AI.

# File function

- MCTS_alphago.py: MCTS for the alphago algorithm
- MCTS_pure: pure MCTS algorithm
- policy_value_net.py: policy and value neural network used in the alphago algorithm
- train.py: train pipeline to train the neural network in the alphago algorithm
- plot_heat_map.py: utility function to plot the heatmap used in the article.
